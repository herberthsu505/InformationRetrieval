I bet youre wonderin how I knew
Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I loved you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday
Dont you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh Im just about to lose my mind
Honey honey yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine baby
I know a man aint supposed to cry
But these tears I cant hold inside
Losin you would end my life you see
Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you loved someone else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
And Im just about to lose my mind
Honey honey yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine baby
People say believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear
But I cant help but be confused
If its true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before
Dont you know I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine baby yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
Im just about to lose my mind
Honey honey yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine baby yeah
Honey honey yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine baby yeah yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine baby yeah yeah
